**Diversity and Inclusion toolkit**

Diversity and inclusiveness are not a finite goal, it's an ongoing journey. If we do nothing, the journey is going to slow. If we do something, we can accelerate, but accept that it will take time to change. It starts with keeping this top of mind, keeping an open mind and having honest discussions. This toolkit is aimed to support and guide those discussions.
