# Diversity and Inclusion toolkit

Diversity and inclusiveness are not a finite goal, it's an ongoing journey. If we do nothing, the journey is going to slow. If we do something, we can accelerate, but accept that it will take time to change. It starts with keeping this top of mind, keeping an open mind and having honest discussions. This toolkit is aimed to support and guide those discussions.

## Why diversity & inclusion matters

Diversity is our world’s biggest asset, and inclusion is our world’s biggest challenge. In order to enable every person, and every organization, we must embrace all walks of life. We will better serve everyone on the planet by representing everyone on the planet. And as a result, our ideas are better, our products are better and our customers are better served. We also want to empower every employee to be able to come to work as they are, feeling valued and respected. By being open to learning our own biases and changing our behaviors we can tap into the collective power of everyone at Microsoft. We don’t just value differences, we seek them out, we invite them in. This means consistently encouraging employees to not hide who they are and  to celebrate what they bring as their very best and most authentic selves. It means that we must look at diversity not as a trend or a buzz word, but rather as a natural development worthy of celebration. We should think about inclusivity not as a quota or a corporate directive, but as an ongoing opportunity for growth and enlightenment.
